                    audience and be useful to them. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to befriend Google's
                    mechanisms and algorithms. There is no use of a pretty website, if it's displayed on a 10th page
                    of search results, because this way no one will ever find it. That brings us to the topic of
                    Google's Website Ranking.Generally speaking, it's a list of pages and their keywords, sorted in
                    the order of search results. The higher your place in the ranking is, the more people are likely
                    to see your page.

                        <p> <strong>Smart headphones</strong> — also called smart earbuds or hearable — are high-tech
                            in-ear devices that do more than transmit audio. These headphones are usually wireless, and
                            they can sync up with your phone, tablet, computer or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The
                            main appeal of hearables is convenience, as they allow you to complete common tasks without
                            directly accessing your phone or computer. Smart wireless headphones sync up to other
                            devices using Bluetooth technology, and many of their features rely on data from your
                            smartphone or computer.
